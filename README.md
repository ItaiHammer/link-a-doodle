A sleek, modern URL shortener that makes sharing links simple.

Built with React, Framer Motion, Express API, MongoDB, and Docker, Link A Doodle features a clean interface that makes sharing and tracking links effortless and accountless.

We designed Link A Doodle as a simple, accountless solution because we know you donâ€™t want to create an account just to share a link.
