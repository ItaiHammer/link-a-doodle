---

## üìö Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v10.9.2 recommended) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItaiHammer/link-a-doodle/link-a-doodle.git
   cd link-a-doodle
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Application

### Running Locally

1. #### Running in development mode

   From the `root` directory:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This runs both the React frontend and Express backend concurrently using the `concurrently` library:

   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000/`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:5000/`

   Changes in either folder will automatically reload the app using React for the frontend and `nodemon` for the backend.

2. #### Running in production mode

   From the `root` directory

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This runs `npm run build:frontend`, which navigates into the `/frontend` directory and generates a static production build in `/frontend/build`.

   Now start the backend with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This starts the Express backend and serves the static frontend files from the `/frontend/build` directory at:

   - `http://localhost:5000/`

### Running with Docker (No Longer Working)

To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build and Start the Containers**

   From the root directory, run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for the frontend, backend, and Nginx reverse proxy.

2. **Access the Application**

   Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application at `http://localhost`.

## üîß Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# .env
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri_here
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

- MONGO_URI
  - This is the connection string for your [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) database.
  - Example format: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
- CLIENT_URL
  - This is the origin that the backend server will allow through [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS).
