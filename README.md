## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Application

### Running Locally

1. #### Frontend

    From the `/frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser.

1. #### Backend

    From the `/api` directory

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Express server with nodemon for automatic restarts on file changes.

### Running with Docker

To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build and Start the Containers**

    From the root directory, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for the frontend, backend, and Nginx reverse proxy.

2. **Access the Application**

    Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application at `http://localhost`.

## üîß Environment Variables

On the backend, create a `.env` file in the `/api` folder:

```env
# api/.env
PORT=5000
